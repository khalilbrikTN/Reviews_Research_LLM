<p>There was a slight confusion in this case as well: -&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to create a new reservation I went ahead to Make Reservation and entered a random_email(not admin's/registered user's) and selected a flight. It goes ahead and creates a successful reservation with user email = random_email entered. However, when I go to check upcoming flights, I have my new reservation and when I list user, I am able to see the email id as admin's. Which(is correct), is confusing because, on the ""List Reservation"", the user email entered is listed as the entere random_email. The same is visible in ""My Reservations"" as well.</p>
<p>I think it would be better to add a check to see if the entered email in ""Make Reservation"" exists in the database already. If not, it should display an error.</p>",3,Hello,1,1,

7147,"If any attributes are missing for users, please mention which one(s).",45316,33864,1,"<p>All attributes are present. but I would consider adding the credit cards as part of the User form.</p>
<p>This is because, while trying to book a flight as an admin, the credit card dropdown doesn't list any cards, unless I go and add a card first. Another reason to look into this, is because, it is an attribute of the user. So if I add a card individually, I have no link with the created card and the user/admin creating it. For instance, I created two cards for testing admin but I have no way of accessing that at the user end as they have no connection with the user I created while being an admin. (I hope it's clear)</p>
<p>So if you want to retain this functionality, a better way to do so would be to include 'add a card' link to the flight booking page itself(in place of a drop down). Further a more meaningful way, is to make avilable the admin cards(which were already there in the card list when i started testing) to be available for the dropdown in the flight booking page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your thinking was to not enable non-admin cards to the admin for purchasing a flight, again you could add the card information to the user's form(pre-recorded in case of admin) and then display it in the dropdown for booking a flight.</p>
<p>Credit - card functionality --&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The system is accepting expired cards as well. You may want to include a filter for that.</li>
<li>Another thing I noticed many people applying to theirs is the check that a credit card contains 16 numbers. You may want to implement that as well, if you see fit.</li>

If you're still working on how to do this (easily) I highly recommend looking into sending emails via a gmail account instead of going to the hassle of setting up a smtp server on your production device. Other teams used heroku and I had more specific hints to share for them, but the procedure should be mostly-sort-of the same on your server/container: make a gmail, set your environment vars properly, lower the security inside the gmail account itself, and implement sending via authenticated smtp on rails.</p>",1,Super Dope Team Name,2,2,

<p>Feedback controller also works good. good job on having a separate method setup_feedback to get the feedback deatils of the current user and flight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the flights controlloer, for method - index, they have used search_flgihts to lookup the flight based. Which again reiterates the good use of having methods implement one task. setup_flight_create and setup_flight_update are two other functions that have specific works that are pushed to a function call for the methods create and update respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Reservations controller has functions that perform individual tasks for different methods to complete their actions. Good implementeation on the round trip reservation and the corresponding functions(setup_round_trip_create_reservation). Quite verbose inside the function itself, but good that its compartmentalized.</p>
<p>User controller also has neat bifurcation of functionality within the different methods.</p>

<p>Still remaining ISSUES include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round trips are only partially implemented. In a real airline reservation system, round trips consist of two one-way trips with distinct departure/arrival dates that are related by sharing origin/destination pairs -- this way, users can pick different return dates. In this system, various flights are classed as ""round trips"" but only have a single departure date. Therefore, change-of-date also doesn't work quite right, but getting round trips to 100% implementation is not a far reach with your working flight query and date-change systems in place.</li>
<li>Change-of-date on a reservation allows me to select a date from the past (2017)</li>
<li>I am able to leave feedback multiple times for the same reservation.</li>
