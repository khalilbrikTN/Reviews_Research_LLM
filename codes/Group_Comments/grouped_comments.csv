It is also unclear what exactly it means to ""check in"" and ""checkout"" of a property. Properties have a ""Occupied By"" field, but it only takes an integer (presumably the Applicant ID?), and can be editted by anyone andset to any number arbitrarily. Applicants should only be able to apply for and""Show"" properties, not edit them, and should only be able to view the statusof their applications, not edit them (apart from Withdrawing them). Further,an applicant should only be able to see their own applications. This can beenforced by checking what applications match the applicant's ID and onlyshowing those when rendering a page. Limiting the access of Applicants couldthen be done by checking this same ID and only rendering the elements of indexpages they should be able to access through a check of that ID.
